# Competitor Analysis: Gym Management Software

## Market Overview
The market is dominated by expensive, legacy platforms (Mindbody, Glofox) that charge high subscription fees PLUS transaction fees.

**The Opportunity:** Local gyms hate paying "platform taxes" (3-5% of revenue). They want a simple, branded experience without the bloat.

## 1. Glofox (The Main Rival)
**Target:** Boutique fitness & martial arts.
- **Pricing:** Starts ~$233/mo (billed quarterly) + **5% transaction fee**.
- **Pros:** Robust feature set, good reporting.
- **Cons:** Extremely expensive. 5% fee is a revenue killer. Member app is generic "Glofox" app unless you pay huge extra fees for white-label.
- **Where JMT Wins:**
  - **Price:** $199/mo vs $233/mo.
  - **Fees:** 0% vs 5%. (On $10k revenue, this saves $500/mo).
