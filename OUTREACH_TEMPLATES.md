### Template A: The "Math" Angle (Best for Glofox/Mindbody Users)
**Subject:** Saving [Gym Name] $7k/year on software fees?

Hi [Owner Name],

I'm Isaac, a developer based in Singapore (and a Muay Thai practitioner myself).

I recently built a custom app for **Jai Muay Thai** to replace their expensive Glofox subscription. By switching, they are saving **~$7,600/year** because we eliminated the 5% transaction fees entirely.

I'm looking for 2-3 more local gyms to work with this month. I can build you a fully branded app (your logo, your colors) that handles:
- Class Booking & Waitlists
- PT Scheduling & Commission Tracking
- Payroll generation
- Member portal (iOS/Android)

And it costs less than half of what you pay Mindbody/Glofox.

Open to a 10-min chat this week? I can show you the live app running at JMT.

Best,
Isaac Yap

### Template B: The "Branding" Angle
**Subject:** [Gym Name] mobile app (ios/android)

Hey [Owner Name],

Love what you guys are doing at [Gym Name].

I noticed you're using [Current Software] for bookings. One thing a lot of owners hate is that members have to download a generic app instead of one with *your* brand.

I build custom white-label apps for gyms. Your members would download "[Gym Name] App" directly from the App Store. It looks premium, works faster, and—crucially—saves you about **3-5% on every transaction** compared to the big platforms.

I'm helping Jai Muay Thai with this right now. Would you be open to seeing a demo?

Cheers,
Isaac

Hi [Name],

Just floating this to the top.

Even if you aren't ready to switch today, I'd love to send you a case study on how JMT cut their software costs by 70%. It might be useful for your next planning cycle.

Let me know if you want me to send it over.

Thanks,
Isaac
