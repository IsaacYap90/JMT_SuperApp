# Steve Jobs Product Review: JMT Super App 🍏

**Date:** Feb 10, 2026
**Verdict:** **Functional, but not yet Magical.**
**Rating:** 6/10 (The soul is there, but the execution is cluttered).

## 1. Member Portal (The Client)

*"If the user can't figure it out, you're the one who's stupid."*

### Simplicity & Flow
- **Waitlist Logic:** You show a "Waitlist" button but no backend logic? That's a lie to the user. Don't ship lies. Either build it or kill it.
- **Booking Flow:** I tap "Book", I get an Alert "Success". Boring. Where is the **delight**? Why doesn't the button transform into a checkmark? Why doesn't the phone vibrate? Make it feel real.
- **Navigation:** "My PT" vs "Classes". Why separate tabs? A user just wants to "Train". Combine them into a single "Schedule" view that shows *everything* I have coming up. Simplify.

### Say No To
- **Profile > Settings > Privacy Policy Link:** Who reads this? Bury it deep or kill it. Don't waste prime real estate.
- **Greeting:** "Good morning, Isaac". It's a nice touch, but does it *do* anything? If not, make it useful. "Good morning, Isaac. You have class at 5pm."

### The Fix
- **Unified Schedule:** One timeline for Classes + PT.
- **Visual Feedback:** Animation on booking. Confetti. Something.
- **Empty States:** "No classes scheduled" is lazy. Show a button: "Find a Class". Drive the action.

## 2. Coach Portal (The Talent)

*"It's not just a tool. It's their livelihood."*

### Simplicity & Flow
- **Earnings Summary:** It's too complex. "Pending Verification", "Pending Payment", "Total Pending". A coach cares about one thing: **"How much am I getting paid on Friday?"** Make that number huge. Hide the rest.
- **Verification:** Why does a coach have to "Mark Attended"? Can't we use Geofencing? Or a QR code? Tapping buttons is for clerks. Make the technology do the work.

### Delight
- **Payroll:** When a payslip is ready, don't just show a list. Send a push notification: "Cha-ching! 💰". Make payday a celebration.

### The Fix
- **One Number:** Big bold "Earning this Week".
- **Auto-Verify:** Explore QR codes or simple "Swipe to Verify" instead of taps.

## 3. Admin Portal (The Boss)

*"Jeremy shouldn't need a manual."*

### Simplicity & Flow
- **HR Tab:** You added 5 tabs (Payslips, Coaches, Leave, Attendance, Documents). Too much. Jeremy is busy.
- **Critical Path:** What does Jeremy do daily?
    1.  Check Attendance.
    2.  Approve Leave.
    3.  Approve Payments (once a week).
-   **Dashboard:** Currently shows "Active Members". Boring. Show **"Revenue Risk"**. Who hasn't renewed? Who is canceling? Give him actionable intelligence, not just data.

### Say No To
- **"Documents" Tab:** Is this a file storage app? No. Use Google Drive for contracts. Don't bloat the app with features you can't maintain. Focus on the core: **Operations**.

### The Fix
- **Dashboard Action Feed:** "3 Leave Requests Pending", "5 Payments to Approve". Don't make him hunt for tasks. Bring the tasks to him.
- **Kill "Documents":** It's bloat.

## Final Verdict

You built a **database viewer**. You need to build an **experience**.

**Priority 1:** Make the Member Booking flow feel magical (Animation, Haptics).
**Priority 2:** Simplify the Coach Dashboard to "One Number".
**Priority 3:** Turn the Admin Dashboard into an "Action Center" (Tasks vs Stats).

*“Details matter, it’s worth waiting to get it right.”*
